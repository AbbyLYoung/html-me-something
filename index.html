       <h3>In the Beginning</h3>

       <p>We all start out with this beautiful clean slate. We are all set to tackle the world and make our 
           mark or to have marks made on us. Either way it goes, we are ready. I graduated from high school 
           thinking I had it all figured out. Man was I unprepared for the ‘marks’ that lay ahead. I am pretty 
           sure I was not alone. As my children venture out into the world I realize how none of us have any of 
           this figured out.</p>

        <h3>Motherhood</h3>
        <p>I became a mom at 19 years old. This girl taught me more than any other person in my life has 
           taught me. By the time I was 26 years old I found myself surrounded by four little people who 
           challenged me every single day. I learned so many life lessons from these little souls. I grew 
           up with them.</p>

        <h3>Epiphany Moment</h3>
        <p>I had developed a thirst for new knowledge; mostly contributed to these little people who are 
            no longer little. They have all graduated high school and are living their best lives . . . best 
            for now anyway. When my kids were little I was not able to work. I was a single mother and had a 
            child with diabetes from the age of three and one who had heart surgery at 18 months old. This is 
            when I became a medical professional (haha). I learned soooo very much in such a short time period. 
            This was surprising to me because I was a terrible student. I had some attention problems and was 
            labeled very early as learning disabled. No one expected much out of me so I did not give much. It 
            was a lot more fun to play than work anyway.</p>

        <h3>Life Goes On</h3>
        <p>I was far from lazy and I just could not sit back and do nothing. I started going to school. It sucked. 
            It was very difficult being a single mom of four and a student (of which I was bad at). I do not know 
            how to quit though. So, on I went. I got my Associates degree in computer programming and network 
            management. I was going to rule the world! That did not happen. I still could not work. We got fired 
            from so many baby sitters. It became comical. My kids were a handful, or a truck full, depending on who 
            you asked. I decided to keep going with school. I did not know what to do or what school to attend. I 
            spent a semester at one university and got lied to. I can tolerate many things but being lied to is not 
            one of them. I decided God was telling to do something else for a while. I found a great job. I started 
            working again. My kids were getting older. I was working!!!</p>

        <h3>Leaders</h3>
        <p>Then my boss, probably the most amazing boss I have ever had, convinced me to peruse my Bachelor’s degree. 
            I completed my Bachelor’s degree (after four very long years) 9 years after I got my Associates degree. 
            In the interim I learned so many other skills; cooking, more medical care, therapist, advocate, seamstress, 
            lawn care, handyman, mechanic, etc. (you get the point).</p>

        <h3>No Where Near the End</h3>
        <p>Somewhere in there I got married and divorced and remarried the same person (lesson learned, that WILL 
            NOT happen again). Then . . . my Master’s degree. Augggg. What was I thinking? Good grief, that was a 
            difficult adventure, but I do not seem to pick easy paths. I have a great job and make decent money. 
            I also lifeguard and teach swim lessons. The path life takes you on is amazing. Ride the waves. Learn 
            to stay on the board and how to gracefully fall off (or be hurled through the air like a chef throwing 
            a pizza crust). Never stop learning and do not give up. At the darkest is where we learn the most if 
            we are open to the suggestion.</p>
